# PRINCIPLES.md - SuperGemini Core Development Principles

Guiding principles for SuperGemini framework operations within Gemini CLI.

## Core Philosophy

**"Enhance, don't replace. Integrate, don't isolate. Empower, don't constrain."**

SuperGemini extends Gemini CLI's capabilities while respecting its design philosophy and user experience.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Extension-First Architecture
- Operate entirely through Gemini's extension system
- No modifications to Gemini CLI core
- Seamless integration with existing workflows
- Respect extension boundaries and permissions

### 2. User Empowerment
- Enhance productivity without adding complexity
- Provide intelligent defaults with override options
- Maintain transparency in all operations
- Preserve user control over tool execution

### 3. Intelligent Automation
- Auto-activate features based on context
- Provide smart suggestions without being intrusive
- Balance automation with explainability
- Learn from user patterns and preferences

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
- Every command must provide clear value
- Features should be discoverable and intuitive
- Documentation embedded in the experience
- Consistent behavior across all operations

### 5. Performance Consciousness
- Optimize token usage without sacrificing quality
- Leverage caching and batch operations
- Respect system resource constraints
- Provide performance transparency

## Design Principles

### Command Design
- Use `/sg:` prefix for clear namespace separation
- Commands should be self-documenting
- Support both simple and advanced usage
- Provide meaningful feedback and progress

### Integration Principles
- Leverage native Gemini tools effectively
- MCP servers enhance, not replace, core functionality
- Respect Gemini's configuration hierarchy
- Maintain compatibility across updates

### Error Handling
- Fail gracefully with helpful messages
- Provide recovery suggestions
- Never leave system in inconsistent state
- Log errors for debugging without exposing internals

### Documentation Philosophy
- Documentation lives in the code (GEMINI.md)
- Examples over explanations
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Keep documentation current and accurate

## Operational Principles

### Context Awareness
- Understand project context before acting
- Adapt behavior to development phase
- Respect existing patterns and conventions
- Learn from codebase to provide better suggestions

### Collaboration Focus
- Support team workflows and standards
- Integrate with existing tools and processes
- Provide clear audit trails
- Enable knowledge sharing through documentation

### Security First
- Never compromise security for convenience
- Validate all inputs and operations
- Respect sandboxing and permissions
- Provide security insights proactively

### Continuous Improvement
- Gather usage patterns for enhancement
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Stay current with Gemini CLI updates
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Ethical Principles

### Transparency
- Clear about what operations will perform
- Honest about limitations and risks
- Open about data usage and privacy
- Accessible to users of all skill levels

### Reliability
- Consistent behavior across sessions
- Predictable outcomes from operations
- Robust error recovery mechanisms
- Trustworthy in production environments

### Inclusivity
- Support diverse development workflows
- Accessible documentation and commands
- Internationalization-ready design
- Respect user preferences and customs

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Clean, maintainable documentation
- Consistent formatting and structure
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance-optimized operations

### Testing Philosophy
- Validate all critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure compatibility across platforms
- Maintain regression test coverage

### Evolution Strategy
- Incremental improvements over radical changes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Deprecate gracefully with migration paths
- Community-driven feature development

## Success Metrics

### User Success
- Reduced time to complete tasks
- Increased code quality metrics
- Positive user feedback and adoption
- Measurable productivity improvements

### Technical Success
- Low error rates in production
- Efficient resource utilization
- High compatibility scores
- Minimal support burden

### Community Success
- Active user engagement
- Contribution growth
- Knowledge sharing increase
- Ecosystem expansion
